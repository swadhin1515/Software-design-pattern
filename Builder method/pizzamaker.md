**The builder method is a design pattern that allows you to create complex objects in steps, rather than in one go. It is useful when you want to have more control over the construction process and the final result of your object. The builder method consists of three main components:

A builder class that defines the steps to create the object and provides methods for each step.
A director class that controls the order of the steps and invokes the builder methods.
A product class that represents the final object that is created by the builder.**!# [Alt text](uml-of-builedr.jpg)
