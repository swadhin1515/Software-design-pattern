The strategy pattern is a design pattern that allows you to switch between different algorithms or strategies at runtime, depending on the context. It is useful when you have multiple ways of solving a problem and you want to choose the best one for each situation. The strategy pattern consists of three main components:

--- A # context class that maintains a reference to a strategy object and delegates the execution to it.
---- A # strategy interface that defines a common method for all concrete strategies.
--- One or more # concrete strategy classes that implement the strategy interface and provide different algorithms.
