****Design patterns are general, reusable solutions to common problems that arise during the design and development of software. They represent best practices for solving certain types of problems and provide a way for developers to communicate about effective design solutionsÂ¹.

There are mainly three types of design patterns: creational, structural, and behavioral. Here is a table that summarizes them:

| Type | Description | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Creational | These patterns deal with the creation of objects. They abstract the instantiation process and make the system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented. | Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Singleton, Prototype, Builder |
| Structural | These patterns deal with the composition of objects. They describe how classes and objects are organized to form larger structures. They increase the functionality of the classes and objects involved, without changing much of their composition. | Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy |
| Behavioral | These patterns deal with the communication and responsibility of objects. They describe how objects interact and cooperate with each other. They characterize complex control flow that is difficult to follow at run-time. | Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method, Visitor |****
